      enabled: true
      auto-detect: true
      data-collection:
        interval: 15s
        retention-period: 1h
      endpoints:
        include: "*"
        exclude: "heapdump,shutdown"
      alerts:
        enabled: true
        thresholds:
          cpu-usage: 80
          memory-usage: 85
          disk-space: 90
```

## Integration Plan

### Auto-Detection Mechanism
- Detect Spring Boot Actuator on the classpath
- Verify actuator endpoints are enabled and accessible
- Automatically register the plugin when conditions are met

### UI Integration
- Add Actuator Insights to the main navigation
- Implement a tab-based interface for different actuator features
- Design tabs to be visually distinct yet cohesive with the main Kraven UI
- Ensure tab state persistence across page refreshes
- Implement smooth transitions between tabs
- Support keyboard navigation between tabs (arrow keys, tab key, shortcuts)
- Allow tabs to be bookmarked directly via URL parameters

### Data Collection Strategy
- Use non-blocking reactive clients for endpoint polling
- Implement backoff strategy for unavailable endpoints
- Cache data to minimize endpoint calls
- Use WebSocket for real-time updates when available

### Plugin Communication
- Define clear API contracts for plugin-core communication
- Implement event-based notification system
- Use standardized data formats for interoperability

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: High-Frequency Data Collection
**Solution**: Implement adaptive polling with backoff strategies and WebSocket support where available.

### Challenge: Large Data Visualization Across Multiple Tabs
**Solution**: Use data aggregation, virtualized rendering, and progressive loading techniques. Implement tab-specific data loading to avoid overwhelming the browser with all tab data at once.

### Challenge: Thread Dump Analysis
**Solution**: Implement custom parsing and visualization algorithms with filtering capabilities.

### Challenge: Real-Time Updates Across Multiple Tabs
**Solution**: Combine WebSocket for push notifications with efficient UI rendering using change detection strategies. Implement a central event bus to distribute updates to visible tabs while queuing updates for hidden tabs.

### Challenge: Historical Data Storage
**Solution**: Implement time-series data storage with automatic aggregation for older data points.

### Challenge: Tab State Management
**Solution**: Implement a robust tab state management system using a combination of Angular services, local storage, and URL parameters. Use NgRx or a similar state management library to maintain tab state across the application.

## Conclusion

The Actuator Insights feature will transform how developers interact with Spring Boot Actuator data, providing intuitive visualizations and actionable insights through a well-organized tab-based interface. By following this roadmap, we will deliver a powerful, user-friendly tool that enhances developer productivity and application reliability.

The tab-based design offers several key advantages:
- **Focused Context**: Each tab provides a dedicated view for a specific aspect of actuator data
- **Improved Navigation**: Users can quickly switch between different views without losing context
- **Better Organization**: Related information is logically grouped within tabs and sub-tabs
- **Enhanced Usability**: Tab persistence ensures users can return to their previous state
- **Scalability**: The tab system can easily accommodate new features in the future

This feature aligns with Kraven UI's mission to provide developers with modern, interactive tools for Spring Boot application development and monitoring, further establishing it as an essential companion for Spring Boot developers.
