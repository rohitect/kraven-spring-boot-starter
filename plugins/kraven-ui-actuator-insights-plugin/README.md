## 🔧 Installation

The Actuator Insights plugin is automatically included with Kraven UI. No additional installation is required.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configure the plugin using your application's `application.yml` or environment variables:

```yaml
kraven:
  plugins:
    actuator-insights:
      enabled: true
      auto-detect: true
      base-url: "http://localhost:8080"
      context-path: ""
      data-collection:
        interval: 15s
        retention-period: 1h
      endpoints:
        include: "*"
        exclude: "heapdump,shutdown"
      sensitive-data:
        mask-sensitive-values: true
        sensitive-patterns: "password,passwd,secret,credential,token,key,auth,private,access"
```

> **Note:** The plugin will automatically use the application's actual port from `server.port` and context path from either `server.servlet.context-path` or `spring.mvc.servlet.path` if they are configured in your Spring Boot application. The `base-url` and `context-path` settings above are only used as fallbacks.

### Environment Tab Features

The Environment tab provides a comprehensive view of your application's configuration:

#### Advanced Search and Filtering
- Search across all property sources with real-time highlighting
- Filter property sources to show only matching properties
- Collapsible sections for easy navigation of large configuration sets

#### Property Source Visualization
- Hierarchical view of all property sources with property counts
- Origin tracking for each property (where it was defined)
- Special formatting for different value types (strings, numbers, objects, arrays)

#### Active Profiles and Application Info
- Visual display of active Spring profiles
- Detailed application information from the info endpoint
- Automatic refresh on demand

#### Spring Boot Masking

In Spring Boot 3, all environment property values are masked by default in the `/env` endpoint for security reasons. If you want to display the actual values, you need to add the following configuration to your application:

```yaml
management:
  endpoint:
    env:
      show-values: always
```

Alternatively, you can set it to `when-authorized` to only show values to authenticated users with appropriate roles.

#### Plugin Sensitive Value Masking

The Actuator Insights plugin provides an additional layer of security by masking sensitive values in environment properties. This is enabled by default and can be configured using the `sensitive-data` configuration options.

The plugin will mask values for properties whose keys contain any of the configured sensitive patterns (e.g., "password", "secret", "token", etc.). You can customize the list of sensitive patterns or disable masking entirely if needed.

This feature is particularly useful when:
- You want to display most environment values but mask sensitive ones
- You're using Spring Boot 2.x which doesn't have built-in masking
- You need more fine-grained control over which values are masked

### Thread Analysis

The Thread Analysis tab provides comprehensive insights into your application's thread usage and potential concurrency issues:

#### Thread State Visualization
- Color-coded thread state distribution (RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, TERMINATED)
- Interactive thread list filtered by state
- Detailed thread stack trace viewer

#### Thread Analysis Types
The plugin offers multiple analysis types to help diagnose different issues:

| Analysis Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| State Distribution | Overview of thread states with percentages |
| Deadlock Detection | Identifies circular dependencies between threads |
| Lock Contention | Finds locks with multiple waiting threads |
| Thread Pool Analysis | Groups threads by common pools (Tomcat, HikariCP, etc.) |
| Stack Trace Patterns | Identifies common patterns in thread stack traces |
| Thread Grouping | Groups threads by naming patterns |
| CPU-Intensive Threads | Identifies threads likely consuming CPU resources |
| Memory Leak Indicators | Finds potential memory leak indicators |
| Comprehensive | Combines all analyses into a single report |

#### Report Generation
Generate detailed PDF reports of thread analysis results for sharing or documentation.

### Conditions Report Features

The Conditions Report tab provides insights into Spring Boot's auto-configuration decisions:

#### Auto-Configuration Analysis
- Understand why certain auto-configurations were applied or skipped
- Categorized view with secondary tabs for positive matches, negative matches, and unconditional classes
- Detailed condition evaluation messages for debugging configuration issues

#### Secondary Tabs Navigation
- **Positive Matches**: View all auto-configurations that were successfully applied
- **Negative Matches**: Examine configurations that were skipped and the exact conditions that weren't met
- **Unconditional Classes**: See configurations that are always applied without conditions
- Fixed tab navigation that remains visible when scrolling through large condition reports

#### Search and Filtering
- Real-time search across all conditions with highlighted results
- Dynamic count indicators showing matches in each category
- Back-to-top button for easy navigation in large reports

This feature is particularly useful when:
- Debugging why certain auto-configurations aren't being applied
- Understanding the startup configuration of your Spring Boot application
- Optimizing your application by removing unnecessary dependencies

### Application Logs Features

The Application Logs tab provides a modern, feature-rich log viewer for your Spring Boot application:

#### Real-time Log Streaming
- Stream logs directly from Spring Boot Actuator's logfile endpoint
- Configure auto-refresh intervals to see the latest log entries in real-time
- Auto-scroll functionality to follow new log entries as they appear

#### Advanced Filtering and Search
- Filter logs by log level with color-coded indicators (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
- Search for specific text with real-time highlighting of matches
- Text-based filtering to show only entries containing specific text

#### Professional Interface
- Syntax highlighting for better readability
- Download functionality for offline analysis
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

#### Configuration Requirements
To use the Application Logs feature, you need to enable the logfile endpoint in your Spring Boot application:

```properties
# Enable logfile endpoint
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=logfile
logging.file.name=/path/to/your/application.log
```

### Log Viewer

The enhanced log viewer provides a powerful interface for viewing and analyzing your application logs:

- **Dual-direction pagination** - Load older logs at the top and newer logs at the bottom
- **Flexible log ordering** - Toggle between newest-first and oldest-first views
- **Real-time search highlighting** - Instantly highlights search terms as you type
- **Advanced filtering** - Filter logs by log level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
- **Auto-scroll functionality** - Automatically scrolls to the newest logs when they arrive
- **One-click download** - Download the complete log file with a single click

This feature is particularly useful when:
- Monitoring application behavior in real-time
- Troubleshooting issues by analyzing log patterns
- Identifying errors and warnings in your application
- Sharing log files with team members for collaborative debugging
- Tracking application startup and shutdown sequences

## 🔍 Auto-Detection

The plugin uses a multi-layered approach to detect Spring Boot Actuator:

1. **Class Detection**: Checks for the presence of key actuator classes in the classpath
2. **Bean Detection**: Looks for actuator-related beans in the Spring application context
3. **Endpoint Detection**: Falls back to checking for accessible actuator endpoints via HTTP

This ensures reliable detection even in complex application environments.

## 💻 Development

### Plugin Architecture

The Actuator Insights feature is implemented as a plugin with two main components:

1. **Backend Plugin Module**: `kraven-ui-actuator-insights-plugin`
   - Responsible for data collection, processing, and API exposure
   - Implements auto-detection of Spring Boot Actuator
   - Manages data caching and historical data storage
   - Handles configuration and settings management

2. **Frontend Components**: Integrated directly into the main Kraven UI Angular project
   - Angular-based interactive UI components
   - Chart and visualization libraries integration
   - Tab-based navigation system
   - Consistent styling with the main Kraven UI

### Building the Plugin

```bash
cd plugins/kraven-ui-actuator-insights-plugin
mvn clean package
```

### Running Tests

```bash
mvn test
```
