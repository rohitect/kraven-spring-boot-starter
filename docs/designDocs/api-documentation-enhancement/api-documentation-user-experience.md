# API Documentation User Experience

This document outlines the user experience and workflows for the enhanced API Documentation feature in the Kraven UI library.

## User Personas

### Service Developer
- Builds and maintains APIs
- Familiar with the API structure and functionality
- Uses the API Playground primarily for testing and debugging

### Non-Service Developer
- Consumes APIs built by service developers
- Limited knowledge of the API structure and functionality
- Needs to discover and understand APIs before using them

### API Consumer
- External user of the API
- No direct access to service developers
- Relies heavily on documentation to understand the API

## Key User Journeys

### 1. Discovering APIs

**User Goal**: Find an API endpoint that provides specific functionality

**Current Flow**:
1. User opens the API Playground
2. User browses through the list of endpoints or uses the basic search
3. User selects an endpoint to view details
4. User tries to understand the endpoint from the parameter and response information
5. If unsure, user contacts a service developer for clarification

**Enhanced Flow**:
1. User opens the API Playground and switches to Documentation mode
2. User searches for functionality using the enhanced search (e.g., "list users")
3. User sees search results with context highlighting
4. User selects a result to view comprehensive documentation
5. User reads the detailed description, parameters, and examples
6. User understands the endpoint's purpose and how to use it
7. User clicks "View in Playground" to test the endpoint

**Benefits**:
- Reduced dependency on service developers
- Faster discovery of relevant APIs
- Better understanding of API functionality

### 2. Understanding API Parameters

**User Goal**: Understand what parameters to provide to an API endpoint

**Current Flow**:
1. User selects an endpoint in the API Playground
2. User sees a list of parameters with basic type information
3. User may not understand the purpose or format of each parameter
4. User may need to experiment with different values or ask a service developer

**Enhanced Flow**:
1. User views the endpoint in Documentation mode
2. User sees comprehensive parameter documentation including:
   - Clear descriptions
   - Example values
   - Constraints and validation rules
   - Default values
3. User sees interactive examples showing how to use the parameters
4. User understands how to properly format the request

**Benefits**:
- Reduced trial and error
- Fewer invalid requests
- Better understanding of parameter requirements

### 3. Learning from Examples

**User Goal**: See examples of how to use an API endpoint

**Current Flow**:
1. User selects an endpoint in the API Playground
2. User may see basic request/response examples if provided in the OpenAPI spec
3. User may need to ask a service developer for example requests

**Enhanced Flow**:
1. User views the endpoint in Documentation mode
2. User sees multiple pre-configured examples for different use cases
3. User can view code examples in multiple languages
4. User can execute examples directly to see the responses
5. User can modify examples to fit their specific needs

**Benefits**:
- Learning by example
- Ready-to-use code snippets
- Understanding different use cases

### 4. Exploring Related Functionality

**User Goal**: Discover related API endpoints for a complete workflow

**Current Flow**:
1. User finds one endpoint for their task
2. User must manually search for related endpoints
3. User may miss important related functionality
4. User may need to ask a service developer about the complete workflow

**Enhanced Flow**:
1. User views an endpoint in Documentation mode
2. User sees a "Related Endpoints" section showing connected APIs
3. User can navigate directly to related endpoints
4. User sees common workflows that involve multiple endpoints

**Benefits**:
- Discovery of complete API workflows
- Understanding of API relationships
- Reduced need for service developer guidance

## Mode Switching Experience

### Documentation to Playground

**Scenario**: User wants to test an endpoint after reading its documentation

1. User is viewing endpoint documentation in Documentation mode
2. User clicks "View in Playground" button
3. UI switches to Playground mode with the same endpoint selected
4. Try It Out panel is automatically opened and focused
5. Any example values from the documentation are pre-filled

### Playground to Documentation

**Scenario**: User wants to learn more about an endpoint they're testing

1. User is testing an endpoint in Playground mode
2. User clicks the mode toggle to switch to Documentation mode
3. UI switches to Documentation mode with the same endpoint selected
4. Documentation view is scrolled to the top of the endpoint documentation

## Search Experience

### Basic Search

1. User enters a search term in the search box
2. Results appear as the user types (after 2-3 characters)
3. Results show endpoint path, method, and a snippet of the matching content
4. Matching terms are highlighted in the results
5. User can click a result to navigate directly to that endpoint

### Advanced Search

1. User enters a search term and clicks the advanced search icon
2. Advanced search panel opens with filters:
   - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Tags (Users, Products, etc.)
   - Response type (JSON, XML, etc.)
   - Authentication required (Yes/No)
3. User selects filters to narrow down results
4. Results update in real-time as filters are applied
5. User can save search configurations for future use

## Interactive Examples Experience

### Viewing Examples

1. User views an endpoint in Documentation mode
2. User sees a list of example requests for different use cases
3. Each example shows:
   - Description of the use case
   - Request parameters and body
   - Expected response

### Executing Examples

1. User selects an example they want to try
2. User clicks "Execute" button
3. Request is sent to the API
4. Response is displayed below the example
5. User can compare the actual response with the expected response

### Customizing Examples

1. User selects an example as a starting point
2. User clicks "Customize" button
3. Example is loaded into an editable form
4. User modifies parameters or request body
5. User clicks "Execute" to test their customized request

## Code Examples Experience

### Viewing Code Examples

1. User views an endpoint in Documentation mode
2. User sees code examples tab with multiple language options
3. User selects their preferred language (cURL, JavaScript, Python, etc.)
4. Code example is displayed with syntax highlighting
5. User can copy the code with a single click

### Customizing Code Examples

1. User views a code example
2. User clicks "Customize" button
3. Customization panel opens with options:
   - Authentication method
   - Request parameters
   - Headers
4. User configures options
5. Code example updates in real-time
6. User can copy the customized code

## Accessibility Considerations

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - All functionality accessible via keyboard
   - Logical tab order
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Proper ARIA labels
   - Meaningful alt text for icons
   - Announcements for dynamic content changes

3. **Visual Accessibility**
   - High contrast mode
   - Adjustable font size
   - Color schemes that work for color-blind users

## Conclusion

The enhanced API Documentation feature provides a comprehensive, user-friendly experience for discovering, understanding, and using APIs. By focusing on the needs of non-service developers and API consumers, we can reduce the dependency on service developers and improve the overall efficiency of API usage.

The dual-mode interface allows users to seamlessly switch between documentation and execution, providing the right tools for each task while maintaining context. The enhanced search, interactive examples, and code snippets further improve the user experience by making it easier to find and use the right APIs for specific tasks.
