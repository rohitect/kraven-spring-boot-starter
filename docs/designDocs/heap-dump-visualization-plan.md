## Phase 1 UI Implementation Plan

### Overview

For Phase 1, we will enhance the memory analysis tab with three key visualization components:
1. Treemap visualization for memory usage by class/package hierarchy
2. Memory region breakdown with stacked area charts
3. Enhanced object histogram with filtering and drill-down capabilities

These visualizations will provide users with a more intuitive understanding of their application's memory usage patterns.

### UI Organization

We will reorganize the "Analysis" tab to include a new set of tertiary tabs for different visualization types:

```
Memory Analysis Tab
└── Secondary Tabs
    ├── Overview
    ├── Heap Memory
    ├── Non-Heap Memory
    ├── Garbage Collection
    └── Analysis
        └── Tertiary Tabs
            ├── Summary (default)
            ├── Treemap
            ├── Memory Regions
            ├── Object Histogram
            └── [Analysis Type Specific]
```

This organization allows users to easily switch between different visualization types while maintaining the context of their analysis.
